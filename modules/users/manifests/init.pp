# shell profile(s) and anything else.

# be used to create all users, and then the users required on the particular
# node are specified through the various user classes.
# Example:
# @useraccount { 'username':
#   ensure   => 'present',
#   uid      => 500,
#   pgroup   => users,
#   groups   => ['staff', 'other'],
#   fullname => 'New User',
#   homefs   => "$homefs",
#   shell    => "$shell",
# }
